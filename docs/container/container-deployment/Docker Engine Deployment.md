The platform provides support for the **Docker Engine Community Edition** with full compatibility to the native Docker ecosystem. Such integration makes it possible to work with the core tools of Docker container technology, namely:

- **Docker Engine** - processes Dockerfile manifests or runs pre-built container images
- **Docker Registry** - stores and provides access to numerous public and private images that are intended for deployment within Docker Engine
- **Docker Compose** - helps assemble applications consisting of multiple components with all the required configurations declared in a single compose file
- **Docker Swarm** - represents several independent Docker nodes interconnected into a cluster

1. **Docker Engine CE** is delivered as the pre-packaged solution available through the [platform Marketplace](/deployment-tools/cloud-scripting-&-jps/marketplace). Use the search field at the top or locate the package under the Dev & Admin Tools category:

2. In addition to the **Docker Version** selection, you can choose from several deployment options when installing from Marketplace:

- **Create a clean standalone engine** - sets up a bare node with just a Docker daemon inside. If needed, you can additionally install **Portainer UI** - a web-based management tool
- **Connect to an existing swarm cluster** - automatically includes this new Docker Engine into the existing Docker Swarm cluster (the appropriate clusterâ€™s Join Token and Host IP are required)
- **Deploy containers from compose.yml** - automatically deploys an application from the linked custom repository

<div style={{
    display:'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    margin: '0 0 1rem 0'
}}>
