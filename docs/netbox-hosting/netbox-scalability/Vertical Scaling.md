Vertical scaling in the context of NetBox hosting is implemented through platform-managed automation, which ensures efficient resource allocation and cost management.

- **[Automatic Vertical Scaling](/application-setting/scaling-and-clustering/automatic-vertical-scaling):** This feature allows dynamic allocation of resources to NetBox nodes. Resources are utilized and billed only when needed, optimizing cost and performance.

NetBox comes with pre-configured defaults that cater to both development and production environments. These settings are designed to provide an optimal balance between performance and resource usage.

For detailed system requirements and scaling options, refer to the NetBox documentation available [here](/netbox-hosting/netbox-getting-started/system-requirements).
