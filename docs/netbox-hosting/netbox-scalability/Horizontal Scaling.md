Horizontal scaling for NetBox is managed by the platform, providing flexibility to handle varying loads and resource demands.

- **[Horizontal Scaling:](/application-setting/scaling-and-clustering/horizontal-scaling)** This allows you to scale NetBox by adding or removing nodes in response to the application's demands. You can set up scaling triggers to automate the scaling process, which will adjust the number of NetBox nodes based on actual resource utilization.

By default, when NetBox is deployed in production mode, it is configured for 'Low Load' to optimize resource use while ensuring availability. For more information on scaling NetBox and configuring it for different loads, you can refer to the detailed guide [here](/netbox-hosting/netbox-getting-started/netbox-installation).
