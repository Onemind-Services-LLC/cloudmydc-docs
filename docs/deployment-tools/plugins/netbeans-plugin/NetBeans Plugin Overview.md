All the functions of the IDE are provided by modules, which allow NetBeans IDE to be extended. Each module provides a well defined function, such as support for the Java language, editing, support for the CVS or SVN versioning system. NetBeans IDE contains all the modules needed for Java development in a single download, allowing the user to start working immediately.

PaaS team has created a plugin for **NetBeans** development platform that simplifies the process of application management and development in the platform.
