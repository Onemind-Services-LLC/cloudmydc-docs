<!-- ## Application Manifest -->

The PaaS allows to create an automated solution for the platform using a **_manifest_** created with the specially developed [Cloud Scripting](https://docs.cloudscripting.com/) tool. Such packaging allows to provide a description of any required environment topology and apply unlimited customization to get precisely the required solution.

Read the following documents to get acquainted with the Cloud Scripting:

- [quick start](https://docs.cloudscripting.com/quick-start/)
- [manifest creation](https://docs.cloudscripting.com/creating-manifest/basic-configs/)
- [CS examples](https://docs.cloudscripting.com/samples/)
- [solution troubleshooting](https://docs.cloudscripting.com/troubleshooting/)

You can use the created manifest for the personal needs (e.g. automation of the common tasks or implementation of the complex CI/CD flows) through [importing](/environment-management/environment-export-and-import/environment-import) to your account. Also, the package can be shared with others via the one-click installation widgets integrated to your website. Another option is to contact hosting service providers and negotiate adding of your solution to the [platform Marketplace](/deployment-tools/cloud-scripting-&-jps/marketplace) on the appropriate platform.
