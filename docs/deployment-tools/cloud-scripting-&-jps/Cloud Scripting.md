Cloud scripting, often referred to as cloud automation or cloud scripting languages, is the practice of using scripting or programming languages to automate and manage tasks, processes, and infrastructure in cloud computing environments. It involves writing code to interact with cloud services and resources, such as virtual machines, databases, storage, and more. These scripts can be used to provision, configure, monitor, and scale cloud resources, making it easier to manage and maintain cloud-based systems. Popular cloud scripting languages include Python, PowerShell, and JavaScript, which can be used to create automation scripts for various cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
