This document represents an overview of the platform fundamental concepts, a versatile solution for hosting inside Public, Private, Hybrid, or Multi-Cloud. The reference below is targeted at those who are new to PaaS and helps to understand the overall landscape of the platform.

Here, we offer a consistent outline of the underlying platform components with pointers to the corresponding documentation, namely:

- [Cloudlet](1)
- [Container](1)
- [Layer](1)
- [Environment](1)
- [Application](1)
- [Host](1)
- [Environment Region](1)
- [Platform Installation](1)
- [Cloud Union](1)

Being informed about the basic components and how they interrelate, you can proceed with more complex scenarios available within the platform.

## Cloudlet

[Cloudlet](1) is the smallest platform infrastructure component. It is a special resource unit that equals to **128 MiB** of **RAM** and **400 MHz** of **CPU** power simultaneously. Such high granularity of resources allows the system to allocate the exactly required capacity for each instance in the environment. This ensures the truly fair [usage-based pricing](1), so that only the really consumed resources are being paid.
