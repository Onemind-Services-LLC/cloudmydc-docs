## OpenSearch Cluster

The **[OpenSearch Cluster](https://cloudmydc.com/)** is a community-driven, open-source search engine. It is most suitable for application search or log analytics cases, as it enables people to easily search, aggregate, view, and analyze data. OpenSearch provides a secure, high-quality search and analytics suite that can be easily modified and extended with additional functionality.

:::tip Tip

_OpenSearch is derived from Apache 2.0 licensed Elasticsearch 7.10.2, allowing the product to be freely used, modified, extended, monetized, and resold._

## OpenSearch Cluster Components Overview

The platform provides OpenSearch Cluster using three certified stacks that are united into a single auto-clustering solution:

- **[OpenSearch](https://cloudmydc.com/)** - a community-driven, open-source search engine that provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search
- **[OpenSearch Dashboards (optional)](https://cloudmydc.com/)** - visualization for data stored inside the OpenSearch nodes (derived from Kibana 7.10.2)
- **[Logstash (optional)](https://cloudmydc.com/)** - data processing

:::tip Tip

Additionally, the **[Beats](https://cloudmydc.com/)** add-on can be installed for single-purpose data shippers that send data from the client nodes to _Logstash_ or _OpenSearch_.

:::

In such a solution, data is gathered on client nodes by **Beats** Data Shippers, sent to **Logstash** (which transforms it the needed way), and stored in **OpenSearch**. **OpenSearch Dashboard** is the supplementary visualization tool.

## OpenSearch

The **OpenSearch** stack is the core and the only mandatory component of the cluster. It is initialized in the cluster mode even when a single node is created, which makes horizontal scaling easier, faster, and safer.

After being created, the OpenSearch node is available on port 9200 for internal communication between nodes of the environment and port 4848 for external services through the shared load balancer. The HTTP basic auth is used in both cases (password can be reset using the **Reset Password** button).

<div style={{

    justifyContent: 'center',
    margin: '0 0 1rem 0'
}}>

</div>

The OpenSearch stack benefits from all the functionality available for other certified templates - dashboard file manager, Web SSH, dashboard log viewer, etc.

Also, platformâ€™s [redeploy](https://cloudmydc.com/) functionality provides a simple update process. However, only redeployment to the same or newer version is allowed - a downgrade is restricted.

## OpenSearch Dashboards

The OpenSearch node is available via browser, but it only shows the JSON with API response (required for API calls). The main tool for visualizing the data is **OpenSearch Dashboards** (replacement on Kibana). All the interconnection configurations are done automatically - the solution is ready for usage out-of-the-box and does not need any manual configuration. Access is available by the same credentials as for the OpenSearch node.

<div style={{
    display:'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    margin: '0 0 1rem 0'
}}>

![Locale Dropdown](./img/Auto-Clustering/02-login-opensearch-dashboards.png)

</div>

After logging in, the OpenSearch Dashboards interface is displayed. The dashboard provides UI for convenient interaction with the OpenSearch API and editing your data (after creating the index pattern).

<div style={{
    display:'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    margin: '0 0 1rem 0'
}}>

![Locale Dropdown](./img/Auto-Clustering/03-opensearch-dashboards-ui.png)

</div>

:::danger Note

The **OpenSearch Dashboards** is not a separate stack and cannot be created separately from OpenSearch. Also, it is limited to one node as scaling provides no additional benefits.

:::

All the regular functionality of certified templates (dashboard file manager, Web SSH, firewall, logs) is also available for this node.

## Logstash

**Logstash** is a data processor component of the OpenSearch cluster that is automatically configured by the platform. Below, you can see an example of default auto-configuration for **_/etc/logstash/conf.d/logstash-sample.conf:_**

<div style={{
    display:'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    margin: '0 0 1rem 0'
}}>

![Locale Dropdown](./img/Auto-Clustering/04-logstash-configs.png)

</div>

The input for _[Beats](https://cloudmydc.com/)_ is assigned on port 5044, and the OpenSearch output is specified by setting the hosts, username, and password for interconnection. [Plugins](https://cloudmydc.com/) for other types of inputs can be installed by the _logstash-plugin tool_, and configs can be added to the same file (with another port).

:::danger Note

The **Logstash** is not a separate stack and cannot be created separately from OpenSearch. You can add as many Logstash nodes as needed - scaling is in [stateful mode](https://cloudmydc.com/) to provide initial configs. However, each node can be reconfigured for different data transformations.

:::

## Beats Add-On

**Beats** is a free and open platform for single-purpose data shippers. They send data from the client nodes to Logstash or OpenSearch.

You can install [Beats add-on](https://cloudmydc.com/) on any node (except alpine-based ones) created inside the platform and specify the credentials to connect to the OpenSearch cluster or [custom Docker](https://cloudmydc.com/) with the ElasticSearch instance. Two versions of the add-on are available:

- **_7.12.1_** - to ship data directly to OpenSearch (see [compatibility charts](https://cloudmydc.com/))

:::danger Note

For direct connection, you need to add the following line to the OpenSearch config and restart node:

```bash
compatibility.override_main_response_version: true
```

:::

- **_latest_** - to ship data to OpenSearch through [Logstash](https://cloudmydc.com/)

<div style={{
    display:'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    margin: '0 0 1rem 0'
}}>

![Locale Dropdown](./img/Auto-Clustering/05-beats-add-on.png)

</div>

During installation, you need to provide the following data:

- **_Installed Agents_** - choose the required Beats types:
  - **[Filebeat](https://cloudmydc.com/)** - forwards and centralizes logs and files. Pre-sets are already available for many certified nodes: Apache (all), NGINX (all), HAProxy, Redis, Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, Percona, MongoDB. _[Tomcat/TomEE](https://cloudmydc.com/)_ requires special configurations.
  - **Metricbeat** - collects metrics from your systems and services.
  - **Journalbeat** - forwards and centralizes log data from systemd journals. Installed as an agent on your servers, Journalbeat monitors the journal locations that you specify, collects log events, and forwards them to _OpenSearch_ or _Logstash_.
  - **Packetbeat** - monitors your network traffic to ensure a high level of performance and security. Packetbeat is a lightweight network packet analyzer.
  - **Heartbeat** - monitors services for their availability with active probing. It checks response time and if the given URLs are alive, then ships this information to other stacks for further analysis.
- **_Beats OSS Version_** - choose the desired version of the agent
- **_OpenSearch Host_** - enter the OpenSearch (or Elasticsearch) host
- **_Credentials_** - provide access information for the specified OpenSearch host (User and Password)
- **_OpenSearch Dashboards Host_** - enter the OpenSearch Dashboards host (may be needed for visualization purposes)
- **_Logstash Host_** - enter the Logstash host (if interconnection is done through the Logstash)

:::danger Note

Simultaneously sending data to OpenSearch and Logstash outputs is not supported - only one output can be used at once. If you want to pass the data through the LogStash - please specify only the LogStash host and port (the OpenSearch host and credentials data is not needed).

:::

- **_Environment name_** - choose the target environment
- **_Nodes_** - choose the target layer

These settings can also be edited for the already installed add-on using the **Configure** button.

<div style={{
    display:'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',

## OpenSearch Cluster Installation

The OpenSearch Cluster creation at the platform is a straightforward and fully automated process that can be performed directly from the [topology wizard](/docs/Container/Container%20Deployment/Custom%20Containers%20Deployment).

Select the **OpenSearch** stack at the NoSQL database section.

<div style={{
    display:'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    margin: '0 0 1rem 0'
}}>

![Locale Dropdown](./img/Auto-Clustering/07-opensearch-topology-wizard.png)

</div>

The stack is automatically configured as a cluster due to the [Auto-Clustering](/docs/ApplicationSetting/Scaling%20And%20Clustering/Auto-Clustering%20of%20Instances) feature. Also, you have additional options to add the **OpenSearch Dashboards** and **Logstash** components.

## OpenSearch vs Elasticsearch Performance

The OpenSearch project was forked from the last ElasticSearch release under the Apache 2.0 license and is almost the same in functionality. The API is completely the same.

Below, we are sharing the results of a performance test on two Magento environments with the same topology:

- Magento with Elasticsearch

<div style={{
    display:'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    margin: '0 0 1rem 0'
}}>

- Magento with OpenSearch

    justifyContent: 'center',
    margin: '0 0 1rem 0'
}}>

![Locale Dropdown](./img/Auto-Clustering/09-opensearch-statistics.png)

</div>

As you can see, OpenSearch provides the same functionality and performance as Elasticsearch and can be used as its full-fledged replacement.
