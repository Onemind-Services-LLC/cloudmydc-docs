## Add SSH Key

When you have your [SSH key generated](/docs/Deployment%20Tools/SSH/Generate%20SSH%20Key), you can add it to your PaaS account.

:::tip

In order to manage private SSH keys intended for authentication at your GIT account, follow the corresponding instruction within the [SSH Access to GIT Repository](/docs/Deployment/SSH%20Access%20to%20GIT%20Repository) guide.

:::

For adding a public SSH key, which subsequently can be used for gaining [SSH access](/docs/Deployment%20Tools/SSH/SSH%20Access/Overview) to your PaaS account, proceed to the steps below:

1. Open the platform dashboard and navigate to the upper toolbar.

<div style={{
    display:'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    margin: '0 0 1rem 0'
}}>

![Locale Dropdown](./img/AddSSHKey/5fe565698fc97a20f4c60d3918356107settings-button.png)

</div>

Click the **Settings** button.

2. The **Account setting** tab with the already selected **SSH Keychain** option will be opened.

<div style={{
    display:'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    margin: '0 0 1rem 0'
}}>

![Locale Dropdown](./img/AddSSHKey/ssh-keychain.png)

</div>

Within this section you can find some information about the SSH protocol usage at the platform and the possibilities it provides with a few useful links to documentation.

3. Once you are acquainted with the details above, switch to the **Public** suboption and click the **Add Public Key** button.

<div style={{
    display:'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    margin: '0 0 1rem 0'
}}>

![Locale Dropdown](./img/AddSSHKey/public.png)

</div>

4. Paste the previously generated public key to the **Key** input field. The **Add Public Key** field will be automatically populated if your key already contains this value (or you can specify your own one here). Click **Add Key**.

<div style={{
    display:'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    margin: '0 0 1rem 0'
}}>

![Locale Dropdown](./img/AddSSHKey/add-key.png)

</div>

5. As a result, the added SSH key will appear in the list, while youâ€™ll simultaneously receive an email with details on it (like title, fingerprint and connection string for your SSH client).

<div style={{
    display:'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    margin: '0 0 1rem 0'
}}>

![Locale Dropdown](./img/AddSSHKey/public-key-list.png)

</div>

In this way, you can add several keys or delete the unnecessary ones using the red-cross button.

:::tip Note

The added SSH key is attached to your account, but not just to a separate environment.
