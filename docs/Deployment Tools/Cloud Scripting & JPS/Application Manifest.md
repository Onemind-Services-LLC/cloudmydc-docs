## Application Manifest

The PaaS allows to create an automated solution for the platform using a **_manifest_** created with the specially developed [Cloud Scripting](https://cloudmydc.com/) tool. Such packaging allows to provide a description of any required environment topology and apply unlimited customization to get precisely the required solution.

Read the following documents to get acquainted with the Cloud Scripting:

- [quick start](https://cloudmydc.com/)
- [manifest creation](https://cloudmydc.com/)
- [CS examples](https://cloudmydc.com/)
- [solution troubleshooting](https://cloudmydc.com/)

You can use the created manifest for the personal needs (e.g. automation of the common tasks or implementation of the complex CI/CD flows) through [importing](https://cloudmydc.com/) to your account. Also, the package can be shared with others via the one-click installation widgets integrated to your website. Another option is to contact hosting service providers and negotiate adding of your solution to the [platform Marketplace](https://cloudmydc.com/) on the appropriate platform.
