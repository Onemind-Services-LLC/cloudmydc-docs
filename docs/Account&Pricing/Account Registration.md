:::tip Tip

If you need to [reset or change password](/docs/Account&Pricing/Account%20Password%20Reset) for your platform account check out the linked guide.

:::

## Sign Up

The PaaS is offered across multiple platforms worldwide, so if you don’t have a specific hosting provider in mind, the best way to choose the most suitable one is to compare options via [Cloud Union](https://cloudmydc.com/).

:::tip Tip

Check out our **[Getting Started](/docs/QuickStart/Getting%20Started)** guide for general information on how to create a new account.

:::

Also, you can register directly from the main website.

1. Go to the [https://jelastic.com/public-cloud-registration/](https://jelastic.com/public-cloud-registration/).

2. Fill in the registration form, choose preferred service provider platform, accept terms of use and privacy policy, and click **Sign Up**.

<div style={{
    display:'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    margin: '0 0 1rem 0'
}}>

</div>

3. Check your email inbox. Depending on the hosting provider you’ve chosen, you can receive one of the following messages:

   - if your Welcome to PaaS email contains automatically generated credentials, just use them for signing into the dashboard and enjoy
   - otherwise, you’ll be provided with a special activation URL. Click it to complete your account registration with the help of the following form:

<div style={{
    display:'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    margin: '0 0 1rem 0'
}}>

![Locale Dropdown](./img/AccountRegistration/02-provide-account-password.png)

</div>

Specify the desired password for your account and confirm it within the appropriate fields.

According to your hosting provider’s settings, this activation form can also contain either [captcha](/docs/Account&Pricing/Account%20Registration#captcha-verification) or [mobile number verification](/docs/Account&Pricing/Account%20Registration#mobile-number-verification) widget:

## Captcha Verification

A captcha widget represents an image with a set of random characters and an input field for these characters to be typed in.

<div style={{
    display:'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    margin: '0 0 1rem 0'
}}>

![Locale Dropdown](./img/AccountRegistration/03-account-activation-with-captcha.png)

</div>

In case you can’t identify the displayed symbols, the image can be reloaded using the round-arrows icon to the right.

## Mobile Number Verification

The mobile number verification widget requires you to specify your phone number for a unique activation code receiving. Additionally, after you are successfully signed up, this number will be bound to your account.

:::tip Note

One phone number can be used for a single account registration only.

:::

<div style={{
    display:'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    margin: '0 0 1rem 0'
}}>

![Locale Dropdown](./img/AccountRegistration/04-account-activation-mobile-phone.png)

</div>

After you click the **Send** button, your activation code will be either sent to the specified mobile phone via SMS or dictated by a robot with the automatic phone call (depends on a hosting provider’s settings). Herewith, the form will be extended with one more 4-cell field for this code entering.

<div style={{
    display:'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    margin: '0 0 1rem 0'
}}>

![Locale Dropdown](./img/AccountRegistration/05-account-activation-phone-code.png)

</div>

Fill each cell with a separate digit of the received code.

:::tip Note

The number of attempts for the activation code entering is limited and depends on your hosting provider settings. If this limit is exceeded, you’ll need to use another phone number to complete the registration.

:::

In case no SMS/call was received, you can either **Edit the phone number** (if it was specified incorrectly) or **Contact support** (if any other issue occurred and you need assistance).

Once all the required data is entered, press the **Continue** button. You’ll be automatically redirected to the platform dashboard, where you can sign in using the credentials you’ve specified and start working.
