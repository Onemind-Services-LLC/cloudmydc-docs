## Kubernetes Cluster: Versions & Change Logs

The platform provides a pre-packages **_Kubernetes (K8s) Cluster_** solution with automatic installation. [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/) is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing container-based workload and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It correlates greatly with the PaaS, allowing to set up applications based on the Kubernetes system directly inside the platform.

By hosting a Kubernetes Cluster at the platform, you can get the following benefits:

- **_Easy Start_** - automated installation in several clicks do not require manual intervention
- **_Hyper Scalability_** - the cluster can be automatically scaled vertically and horizontally
- **_Multi-Cloud Availability_** - mix and match cloud options due to the project needs
- **_Simplified Management_** - a single point of management via intuitive UI and built-in Web SSH
- **_Flexible Automation_** - automate DevOps processes with open API and Cloud Scripting
- **_Cost Efficiency_** - pay only for consumed resources benefiting from container density and scalability

## K8s Package Change Log

You can check the source code of the **_[Kubernetes Cluster](https://github.com/jelastic-jps/kubernetes)_** package at GitHub. You can overview changes in each of the versions by clicking on the required record in the list below.

:::danger Note

Implementation of new features/components for the **Kubernetes Cluster** solution (as well as stability testing) requires a certain amount of time. So, the package version is usually one or two minor releases behind the [Kubernetes upstream tags](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tags).
