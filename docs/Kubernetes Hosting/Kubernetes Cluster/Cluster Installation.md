## Kubernetes Cluster: Package Installation
The **Kubernetes Cluster** solution is available for automatic installation via [platform Marketplace](1) under the Clusters category (or use Search to locate). Note that this clustered solution is available for billing customers only.

</div>

Within the opened installation frame, customize the available options to get a cluster specifically for your needs:

- **Version** - choose a [Kubernetes version](1) for your cluster
- **K8s Dashboard** - select between the v2 and Skooner options (note that some metrics in the skooner dashboard donâ€™t work with the HAProxy ingress controller)
- **Topology**
   - *Development* - one control-plane (1) and one scalable worker (1+)
   - *Production* - multi control-plane (3) with API balancers (2+) and scalable workers (2+)

:::danger Note

The development topology is not recommended for production projects as it cannot handle high load reliably due to a single control-plane instance.

:::

- **Ingress Controller** - choose the preferable [ingress controller](1) for your cluster (NGINX, Traefik, or HAProxy). We recommended using NGINX as it provides the most flexibility
- **Deployment**
   - *Clean cluster* with pre-deployed HelloWorld example
   - *Custom* helm or stack deployed via shell command - chose this option to manually provide commands for custom application deployment from the helm repository

- **NFS Storage** - enable to attach a dedicated NFS Storage with dynamic volume provisioning (disable if you want to register own storage class, requires in-depth K8s knowledge)
- **Modules** (can be enabled later via the add-ons)
   - *Prometheus & Grafana* - check to install these monitoring tools (recommended). This deployment requires an additional 5GB of disk space for persistent volumes and consumes about 500 MB of RAM
   - *Jaeger Tracing Tools* - tick to install Jaeger tracing system for monitoring and troubleshooting
   - *Remote API Access* - check if you plan on using the kubectl command-line tool or some other remote clients
- **Environment** - provide a name for your environment
- **Display Name** - specify an [alias](1)
- **Region** - choose a [region](1) (if available)
