## Kubernetes Cluster: Upgrade Package

The platform actively develops the **Kubernetes Cluster** solution and regularly releases new [versions of the package](https://cloudmydc.com/). Herewith, you donâ€™t need to recreate the whole cluster from scratch to benefit on the new features and tools - the existing environment can be upgraded with a dedicated add-on.

Hover over the Master layer and click the appeared **Add-Ons** button. Then, in the opened section, select the **Upgrade** option for the **Kubernetes Cluster Configuration** add-on panel.

<div style={{
    display:'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    margin: '0 0 1rem 0'
}}>

</div>

Confirm an action via a pop-up, and the platform will perform an automatic update to the next version of the **Kubernetes Cluster**. If the latest version is already installed, the appropriate notification will appear on the dashboard.
