:::danger Note

Elastic VPS instances require [public IP](/application-setting/external-access-to-applications/public-ip) addresses (one per node) by default.

:::

Adjust other options up to your needs ([vertical](/application-setting/scaling-and-clustering/automatic-vertical-scaling) and [horizontal scaling](/application-setting/scaling-and-clustering/horizontal-scaling), disk limit, etc.) and click the **Create** button.

In a moment, your fully isolated virtual server with Debian operating system will be ready to work, allowing you to proceed with the required software and services installation.
