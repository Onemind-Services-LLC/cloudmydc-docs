## Elastic VPS

**Virtual Private Server (VPS)** hosting is popular among developers due to strong security, reliable hosting resources, and expanded flexibility. However, it requires a manual configuration of the hosted application, which could be a difficult task for an average developer. Facing the necessity of scaling (e.g. due to your application success), makes it even harder to maintain a service operable and sufficiently supplied with resources to handle the load without overpaying extra capacities.

The platform solves such elasticity problems through the implementation of the so-called **_Elastic VPS_** stacks. They are offered on top the four different OS types - _[CentOS](https://cloudmydc.com/)_, _[Ubuntu](https://cloudmydc.com/)_, _[Debian](https://cloudmydc.com/)_, and _[Windows](https://cloudmydc.com/)_ - allowing to choose the one, which suits your specific requirements the most.

The distinctive features of the Elastic VPS stacks are:

- **insulation** - each given VPS represents an entirely independent instance, which is accessible only via the dedicated [public IP](https://cloudmydc.com/), so any other account on the hardware cannot influence it
- **full control** - it is possible to manage your virtual server in any preferred way due to the provided root permissions
- **scalability** - the server can be automatically scaled vertically and horizontally by setting the resource limits and specific triggers
- **cost-effectiveness** - VPS is a relatively cheap solution (comparing to the cost of purchase and maintenance of a real dedicated physical server) and due to the platform [usage-based pricing](https://cloudmydc.com/) model
- **management tools** - access to the platform [inbuilt tools](https://cloudmydc.com/) for simplified configuration via the GUI dashboard
- **managed stack** - Elastic VPS software solution is maintained by PaaS team, ensuring regular updates and full compatibility with the platform
  In such a way, you get an instance which is advanced enough to handle big applications with high load and simultaneously ensures their simple administration.
