**[CentOS](https://cloudmydc.com/)** (Community ENTerprise Operating System) is a free community-driven project, with open source code delivered from RHEL Linux distribution.

Due to continuous community contribution, CentOS offers enterprise-level stability strengthened by robust performance and represents a reliable, low-maintenance, secure option for running virtual private servers.

:::danger Note

By default, the VPS node is delivered with the automatically attached Public IP address (one per instance).

The platform provides a set of [inbuilt tools](https://cloudmydc.com/) for applying some basic settings to your VPS instance right via the dashboard UI. For more complicated configs, youâ€™ll need to access it via SSH - this can be accomplished through the SSH Gate or via any [3d-party software](https://cloudmydc.com/) (i.e. external SSH client) using Public IP address.

Once your virtual private server on top of CentOS is set up and properly configured, consider exploring the following example tutorials:
