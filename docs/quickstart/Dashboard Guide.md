![Locale Dropdown](./img/DashboardGuide/60-newEnv.png)

</div>

:::tip Tip

This feature can be used to create a copy of the environment from another PaaS installation (by [exporting](/environment-management/environment-export-and-import/environment-export) it from one platform and [importing](/environment-management/environment-export-and-import/environment-import) it to another).

:::

In the opened **Import** frame, youâ€™ll see three tabs along with an _[Examples](https://github.com/jelastic-jps)_ link to the JPS Collection containing various ready-to-use solutions:

![Locale Dropdown](./img/DashboardGuide/31-import-dialog-window.png)

- **Local File** - Select a file stored on your local machine using the Browse button. This file will be uploaded and executed on the platform.
- **URL** - Enter a direct link to the desired manifest file.
- **JPS** - Use the built-in JSON/YAML editor to insert and edit your code before deployment, or even create your package from scratch.

## Marketplace

Clicking **Marketplace**![Locale Dropdown](./img/DashboardGuide/58-additionallist-icon.png) option at the top of the dashboard will open a separate window displaying a list of pre-packaged solutions available for automatic installation.

These packages are organized into two groups:

**Applications**\_ for creating new environments.

**Add-Ons** for modifying existing ones.

You can search for a specific solution using the search field in the top-left corner or browse through the categorized list in the left-hand menu.
